# NFL Special Teams Analysis Project

## Overview
The NFL Special Teams Analysis Project is an exploratory study based on NFL tracking data from the 2020 season. This project aims to uncover simple yet insightful findings by analyzing player positions and their impact on special teams play. It serves not only as a window into the strategic elements of special teams but also as a demonstration of Python's powerful visualization capabilities when handling large datasets.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is twofold:
- **Insight Discovery**: To analyze special teams data to identify trends, patterns, and insights related to player positions and play outcomes.
- **Visualization Showcase**: To demonstrate how Python can be used to visualize complex data in an intuitive and accessible manner, making it easier to interpret and understand the underlying stories within the data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For efficient data manipulation and numerical analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Utilized for creating a variety of visualizations to illustrate our findings from the data.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and presentation of code, analysis, and visualizations.
